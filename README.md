# Linkedin-Connection-Acceptor
- This Python script uses Selenium to automate the process of accepting LinkedIn connection requests. With this script, you can accept all your pending connection requests with just one click. Simply enter your email address in the email input field and your password in the password input field, and you're all set! Note that if you have a large number of requests, the script might not accept all of them at once.
