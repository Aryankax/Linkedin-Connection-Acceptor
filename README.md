# Linkedin-Connection-Acceptor
- This is a python script which uses Selenium to automate Linkedin connections request acceptance. Using this script you can accept all of your pending connection with just one click. Just enter your email id in the email input and password in the password input field and you'll be good to go! 
(This might not accept all the requests at once if you have large number of requests :p)
